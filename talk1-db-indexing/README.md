## weeek 4 - Database Indexing
This is just "knex-todo-cli" exercise that we did in week 3 with SQL Lite 3 as the DB 




Why I chose it.. get excited!
I chose my topic was Database indexing because ... useful, 

Why its important.
Speed and cost is becoming more important in our ever growing data dependant society 




LINEAR
If not sorted/indexed the computer will have to sort through each line linearly - see picture

DATA STRUCTURE
The index causes the database to create a datastructure which orders the data based on that specifc column and nothing else will be held in the datastructure

POINTER
The datastructe creates a pointer which is an address stored in memory which refers back to the original database and the accossiated row so we can access the rest of the information stored on that row.

BONUS
The first thing i learnt was you can use a database on the commandline
We also lernt "increments" does not need .primary() as it does this automatically
